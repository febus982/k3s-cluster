# Legacy documentation - K3S Nodes PI setup
 
???+ error "Legacy documentation"
    This the legacy documentation. [Click here for the updated one](/)

This requires the Load Balancer PIs to be installed and running. Refer to [Load balancers setup](load_balancers.md).

## PI Network setup

Same as we did for load balancers we turn on one PI at a time. The PIs have to be connected to the ethernet interface so
that they will receive an IP address from the load balancers.

Start the PI, it will become available on `raspberrypi.local` hostname. Run:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null \
 -o ProxyCommand="ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -W %h:%p -q pi@192.168.50.150" \
 pi@raspberrypi.local
```

Note: The `ssh-copy-id` command has different options from the same command in the load balancer setup.

then:

```bash
pipenv run k3s_bootstrap -e new_hostname=master1
```

Repeat the same for all the nodes defined in the ansible inventory, with the proper hostname.

## K3S Nodes PIs provisioning

Run:
```bash
pipenv run k3s_install
```

As soon as the first master node is running a `kubeconfig.yml` file will be generated in the root directory of
the project, ready to be used by `kubectl` command.

When all the nodes are installed you should be able to access the Consul UI to monitor nodes and services on [http://192.168.50.150:8500/ui](http://192.168.50.150:8500/ui).

### Notes

- the step `TASK [apt_dependencies : Run apt dist-upgrade]` might take a while (~10-15 minutes if system is not up to date)
- the step `TASK [k3s_script : Install K3S]` might take a while (~3-5 minutes on PI4)

## K3S Nodes PIs uninstall

This command will uninstall only the K3S binary and config:

```bash
pipenv run k3s_uninstall
```

This will leave the PI ready for the installation of other software (or reinstallation of K3S).
